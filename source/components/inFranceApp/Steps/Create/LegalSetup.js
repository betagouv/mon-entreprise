		<h2>Choosing the liability </h2>
		<p>
			The legal setup is the framework that allows the company to be created. An
			entrepreneur can choose between two major legal options:
		</p>
		<ul>
			<li>
				<strong>Sole proprietorship: </strong>
				This is an economic activity conducted by a single natural person, in
				his own name. It&apos;s less paperwork, but bigger trouble in case of
				bankeroute.
			</li>
			<li>
				<strong>Limited liability: </strong>
				A limited liability company is a corporate structure whereby the company
				members cannot be held personally liable for the company&apos;s debts or
				liabilities.
			</li>
		</ul>
