It is based on a new programming language, <2>publicodes</2>.</3><4>How to use it?</4><5>The following examples show you how to use the library on a very simple ReactJs site.</5><6>1) Make a very simple calculation: from gross to net</6><7><0></0></7><8>2) Browse online documentation</8><9>As you can see from the previous example, the recipe for a calculation is simple: input variables (gross wage), one or more output variables (net wage).</9><10>All these variables are listed and explained in our <2>online documentation</2>.</10><11>Use the search engine to find the right variable, then click on \"View source code\" to get all the documentation: default value, possible values when it's an enumeration of choice, unit when it's a number, description, associated user question, etc.</11><12>Let's run a calculation closer to a payslip: Here is a description of the input situation with links to the corresponding pages of the documentation :</12><13> An <3>executive</3> earning <7>€3,400 gross</7>, who benefits from the<10> bicycle mileage allowance</10> and works in a company with <14>12 employees</14>.</13><14>The calculation for this more complete example is as follows:</14><15><0></0></15><16>{emoji('ℹ️ ')} Note that in the previous example we have to specify the transport payment rate ourselves.</16><17>Whereas in the <2>employee</2> simulator, it is sufficient to fill in the municipality and the corresponding rate is automatically determined. It's intentional: to keep the library (and the site) light, we use two online APIs. The<4> Geo API - communes</4> to switch from the commune name to the common code. Then the<7> transport payout API</7>, developed and maintained by us, which is not documented but its use is very simple and understandable <10>in this React component that calls it</10>, a component that also uses the common API.</17><18>Making economic charts{emoji(' \U0001F4C8')}</18><19>It is also possible to use the library for economic or political analysis calculations. Here, the price of labour and the net wage is plotted against the gross wage.</19><20>We can see the progressiveness of the total wage, which is in percent lower for a minimum wage than for a high income. In other words, high-wage earners pay part of the social security contributions of low-wage earners.</20><21>{emoji('⚠️ ')}Beware, this example does a lot of calculations in one go, which can block your browser for a few seconds. To overcome this problem, you would have to call the library in a Web Worker, but this is not possible for the <3>moment</3> in these demos.</21><22><0></0></22>"

      This estimate is proposed for information only. It is based on the
      applicable regulatory elements and the elements that you have entered, but
      it does not take into account your entire situation. The actual amount of
      your contributions may therefore be different.
    auto-entrepreneur: >-
      Self-employed entrepreneurs cannot deduct their expenses from their

      The simulator does not include the corporate property tax (CFE), which is
      due from the second year of the fiscal year. Its amount varies greatly
      depending on the company's turnover and the company's domiciliation.
