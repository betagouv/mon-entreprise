      mon-entreprise's simulators!</11><12>All available rules are listed and
      explained in the <2>online documentation</2>. This documentation is
      auto-generated from the publicodes rule files, and fed by the current
      simulation.</12><13>How do I reproduce a simulator calculation?</13><14>To

      values without hesitation. They accept any <4>expression or publicodes

        have been historicized. This means that you can run a simulation using

      seo explanation: <0>How do you calculate the net income of an
        auto-entrepreneur?</0><1>An auto-entrepreneur must pay social security
        contributions to the authorities. These contributions are used to
        finance the social security system, and give entitlement to pension and
        health insurance benefits. They are also used to finance vocational
        training. Their amount varies according to the type of
        activity.</1><2><0></0> <2>See how contributions are
        calculated</2></2><3>Don't forget to deduct all expenses incurred in the
        course of your business (equipment, raw materials, premises, transport).
        Although they are not used to calculate contributions and taxes, they
        must be taken into account to check whether the business is economically
        viable.</3><4>The complete calculation formula is therefore</4><5>Net
        income = Sales - Social security contributions - Professional
        expenses</5><6>How is income tax calculated for
        auto-entrepreneurs?</6><7>If you have opted for the "versement
        libératoire" system when setting up your auto-entrepreneur business,
        income tax is paid at the same time as social security
        contributions.</7><8><0></0> <2>See how the disbursement amount is
        calculated</2></8><9>Otherwise, you will be taxed according to the
        standard income tax scale. Taxable income is calculated as a percentage
        of sales. This is known as the standard deduction. This percentage
        varies according to the type of activity. It is said to be flat-rate
        because it does not take into account actual expenses incurred in the
        course of the activity.</9><10><0></0> <2>See details of the calculation
        of deducted income for auto-entrepreneurs</2></10><11>Key information on
        VAT for auto-entrepreneurs</11><12>As an auto-entrepreneur, it's
        important to understand your VAT liability. Generally speaking,
        auto-entrepreneurs are exempt from VAT until their sales reach a certain
        threshold, which varies according to the nature of the activity
        (services or sale of goods).</12><13>Once this threshold is exceeded,
        you are required to collect and declare VAT on your sales or services.
        The VAT rate applied depends on the type of activity and can vary, but
        the standard rate is often around 20%. It's essential to keep abreast of
        current thresholds and applicable rates, as they can change over
        time.</13>

      title: auto-entrepreneur income simulator
      warning:
        cfe: The simulator does not include the business property tax (cotisation
          foncière des entreprises - CFE), which is due from the second year of
          business. Its amount varies greatly depending on sales and the
          company's location. <2>For further information.</2>
        general: Auto-entrepreneurs benefit from a highly simplified system, with a flat
          rate for calculating social security contributions applied to sales.
          Depending on the tax payment method chosen, a flat-rate deduction is
          made for professional expenses. Actual expenses cannot be deducted in
          addition. Your net income is therefore your sales minus all expenses
          incurred for the company.

        etc.).</1><2>It is calculated on the basis of profits made in France
        during the financial year. Normally, a financial year lasts one year,
        but it can be shorter or longer (particularly at the start of a business
        or when the company is wound up). In this case, the tax scale is
        pro-rated according to the length of the financial year, which is taken
        into account in the simulator by modifying the start and end dates of
        the financial year.</2><3>Reduced rate and special schemes</3><4>SMEs
        with sales of less than €7.63 million, 75% of whose capital is held by
        individuals, benefit from a reduced rate of corporation tax. This rate
        is taken into account in the simulator, and it is not currently possible
        to simulate ineligibility for reduced rates.</4><5>Finally, there are
        specific tax regimes with dedicated rates for certain types of capital
        gains (sale of securities, sale of patents). These regimes are not
        included in the simulator.</5>
