  aboutUs: |
    <0>About us</0>
    <1>This website is developed by the administration to <2>support entrepreneurs in the development of their business</2>.</1>
    <2>We start from the premise that it is difficult to navigate through all the online documentation: there is a lack of clear, up-to-date and relevant information on starting a business.</2>
    <3>Our objective is to <2>remove all uncertainties regarding the administration tasks</2> so that you can focus on what matters: your business.</3>
    <4>We are a small, autonomous and multidisciplinary team within the <4>URSSAF</4>. We are committed to being as close as possible to our users in order to continuously improve this site in accordance with the <7>Startup d'État</7> method.</4>
    <5>Feel free to send us your comments and suggestions at <2>contact@mon-entreprise.beta.gouv.fr </2>.</5>

      description: Estimate your income as a SASU or SAS director based on your turnover. All contributions and income tax are taken into account. Official URSSAF simulator
    titre: SAS and SASU directors income simulator
    explications: The equal or minority directors of SARL or the directors of SA and SAS are considered as "assimilé salarié" and are subject to the general regime. Consequently, the director has the same social protection as an employee, apart from unemployment coverage.

    titre: Self-employed income simulator
    explication1: Our estimate takes into account the <1>actual contributions</1> due by the self-employed person. During the first year of his activity, he will pay a reduced flat rate (a sum of around 1300€ / year for a craftsman benefiting from ACRE)... but it will be regularized the following year according to this real amount.
    explication2: Unemployment and occupational accident insurance are not covered by the Social Security for the self-employed. Retirement based on professional income is generally lower. To be covered, the professional may take out additional insurance.
