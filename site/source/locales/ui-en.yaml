      seo explanation: <0>How do you calculate the net income of an
        auto-entrepreneur?</0><1>An auto-entrepreneur must pay social security
        contributions to the authorities. These contributions are used to
        finance the social security system, and give entitlement to pension and
        health insurance benefits. They are also used to finance vocational
        training. Their amount varies according to the type of
        activity.</1><2><0></0> <2>See how contributions are
        calculated</2></2><3>Don't forget to deduct all expenses incurred in the
        course of your business (equipment, raw materials, premises, transport).
        Although they are not used to calculate contributions and taxes, they
        must be taken into account to check whether the business is economically
        viable.</3><4>The complete calculation formula is therefore</4><5>Net
        income = Sales - Social security contributions - Professional
        expenses</5><6>How is income tax calculated for
        auto-entrepreneurs?</6><7>If you have opted for the "versement
        libératoire" system when setting up your auto-entrepreneur business,
        income tax is paid at the same time as social security
        contributions.</7><8><0></0> <2>See how the disbursement amount is
        calculated</2></8><9>Otherwise, you will be taxed according to the
        standard income tax scale. Taxable income is calculated as a percentage
        of sales. This is known as the standard deduction. This percentage
        varies according to the type of activity. It is said to be flat-rate
        because it does not take into account actual expenses incurred in the
        course of the activity.</9><10><0></0> <2>See details of the calculation
        of deducted income for auto-entrepreneurs</2></10><11>Key information on
        VAT for auto-entrepreneurs</11><12>As an auto-entrepreneur, it's
        important to understand your VAT liability. Generally speaking,
        auto-entrepreneurs are exempt from VAT until their sales reach a certain
        threshold, which varies according to the nature of the activity
        (services or sale of goods).</12><13>Once this threshold is exceeded,
        you are required to collect and declare VAT on your sales or services.
        The VAT rate applied depends on the type of activity and can vary, but
        the standard rate is often around 20%. It's essential to keep abreast of
        current thresholds and applicable rates, as they can change over
        time.</13>

  explanation:
    CIPAV: From January 1, 2023, Urssaf will collect basic and supplementary pension
      and disability-death contributions from self-employed professionals
      covered by Cipav. Cipav will continue to manage the pension and provident
      fund file.
    CNAPL: It collects contributions related to your pension and to the
      disability-death scheme.
    institutions:
      cpam: As an approved healthcare professional, part of your contributions are
        reimbursed by the Assurance Maladie.
      dgfip: The Direction Générale des Finances Publiques (DGFiP) is the organization
        that collects income tax. <2>The amount calculated takes into <2>account
        the micro-tax allowance</2>.</2>
      précompte-artiste-auteur: For your salary and wage income, these contributions
        are "précomptée", i.e. paid at source by the broadcaster.
      titre: Your partner institutions
      urssaf: Urssaf collects contributions used to finance the social security system

  précision:
    défaut: "Improve your simulation by answering the questions below:"
  warning:
    artiste-auteur: This simulator allows you to estimate the amount of your
      contributions based on your projected income.
    auto-entrepreneur: Auto-entrepreneurs benefit from a highly simplified system,
      with a flat rate for calculating social security contributions applied to
      sales. Depending on the tax payment method chosen, a flat-rate deduction
      is made for professional expenses. Actual expenses cannot be deducted in
      addition. Your net income is therefore your sales minus all expenses
      incurred for the company.
    cfe: The simulator does not include the business property tax (cotisation
      foncière des entreprises - CFE), which is due from the second year of
      business. Its amount varies greatly depending on sales and the company's
      location. <2>For further information.</2>
    chômage-partiel:
      "1": This simulator does not take into account gross earnings based on a 39-hour
        week.
      "2": Similarly, it does not take into account any additional partial activity
        indemnities provided for by a collective agreement or unilateral
        decision by the employer.
    cotisations-ordinales: For regulated professions, the simulator does not
      calculate the amount of membership fees. They must be added manually in
      the "operating expenses" box.
    coût-création-entreprise:
      JAL: This simulator calculates start-up costs only for SARL, EURL, SAS, SASU, EI
        and SEL. It does not yet take into account other forms of company (SA,
        SCA, SCS, SCI, SCP, SNC, SCM, cooperatives, GIE, GAEC, etc.).
      greffe: Clerk's fees may be charged for missing or incorrect information or
        documents. In addition, the registry charges postage for mailings.
      pas-reprise: This simulator calculates start-up costs for new businesses. It
        does not take into account takeovers of existing companies.
    dividendes:
      "1": This simulation applies only to French companies subject to corporation tax
        (IS), and does not concern self-employed workers.
      "2": Tax on dividends is calculated in addition to tax on other taxable income.
    general: <0>The calculations are indicative.</0> They are based on the
      information you have entered and the applicable regulations, but they do
      not take into account your entire situation. They do not replace actual
      statements from Urssaf, the tax authorities or any other organization.
    indépendant:
      année-courante: The amount calculated corresponds to the contributions for the
        year {{year}} (for an income {{year}}).

      Exemption rates and contribution breakdowns are not taken into

    profession-libérale: This simulator is intended for self-employed professionals
      who earn a BNC. It does not take into account self-employed companies.
    réduction-générale: This simulator does not take into account <2>all</2>
      specific <2>calculation rules</2> (temporary employment agencies, road
      haulage employees subject to equivalent working hours, etc.). Nor does it
      take into account the specific rates and/or distribution of supplementary
      pension contributions applied in certain companies.
    salarié: The simulator does not currently take into account collective
      agreements, nor the myriad of company subsidies. Find your collective
      bargaining agreement <2>here</2>, and explore the range of assistance
      available on <4>aides-entreprises.fr</4>.
