        in the course of the business (equipment, raw materials, premises,

    <1>In France, all workers benefit from quality social protection. This mandatory system is based on solidarity and aims to ensure the <2>general well-being of the population</2>.</1>

    <2>In return for the payment of <2>social security contributions</2>, the contributor is covered for illness, accidents at work, unemployment or retirement.</2>

  transcript-NO_AUTO_TRANSLATION: "<0>Three minutes to understand the challenges
    of social security.</0><1>The purpose of social security is to protect
    people living in France when certain events occur during their
    lives.</1><2>Its budget consists of expenses mainly in the form of benefits
    and of income, financed partly by contributions. Income is managed by the
    collection branch made up of the URSSAF agencies. Regarding expenses, there
    are four branches. The health insurance branch covers hospital costs,
    medecine and consultations. The retirement pension branch registers on each
    person's old-age account their income received throughout their working life
    using companies online declarations in order to calculate and pay pensions.
    the occupational risks branch covers the costs related to occupational
    diseases and accidents at work. the family branch provides various benefits
    regarding birth and child care and allowances for education and housing for
    example. These four branches form the general scheme of the Social Security
    system. Besides the general scheme there are specific organizations such as
    the MSA for farmers and special schemes.</2><3>All people living in France
    help to fund the Social Security system which in  return provides cover for
    all of them. The principle is that of a \"common pot\" which works through
    solidarity each person pays contributions based on their income rather than
    on their risks.</3><4>The Social Security system by providing pensions and
    paying for medical care has extended life expectancy in France by three
    months every year in the past 20 years. This progress leads to financing
    difficulties: longer life expectancy implies more pensions and higher health
    expenses which unbalance the system. To restore its balance, measures are
    being taken especially by extending the contributions duration.</4><5>The
    Social Security system is also increasing its services such as childcare
    capacity for children aged up to three so their parents can keep working. It
    is also developing preventive actions, running immunization campaigns
    programs for the early screening of certain diseases, actions for post
    Hospital support at home, and information about fall danger among the
    elderly.</5><6>Founded seventy years ago, the French Social Security system
    has not only enabled the French to live longer but also better it will
    continue evolving to build the services that meet their needs you.</6>"
