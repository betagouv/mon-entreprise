      reusable thanks to the <2>NPM publicodes library</2>.</1><2>How to use
      this library?</2><3>All our calculation rules are written in `publicodes`,

      rule you want the value of. Here is an example for the gross/net
      calculation</9><10><0></0></10><11>Setting up the calculation</11><12>As
      you can see in the previous example, the recipe for a calculation is
      simple: input variables (gross salary), one or more output variables (net
      salary).</12><13>The calculation is however configurable with all the
      possibilities allowed in the legislation.</13><14>All these variables are
      listed and explained in the <2>online documentation</2>. This
      documentation is auto-generated from the publicode rules files, so it is
      constantly updated.</14><15>Let's run a calculation closer to a pay slip:
      here is a description of the input situation with links to the
      corresponding pages in the documentation:</15><16><0> An <3>executive</3>
      earning <7>€3,400 gross</7>, who receives <11>meal vouchers</11> and works

      calculation looks like for this more complete
      example:</17><18><0></0></18><19><0></0>Note that in the previous example
      we have to specify the rate of transport payment ourselves.</19><20>In the
      <2>employee</2> simulator, however, you only have to enter the
      municipality and the corresponding rate is automatically determined. This
      is deliberate: to keep the library (and the site) light, we use two online
      APIs. The<4>Geo - communes API</4> to go from the commune name to the
      commune code. Then the<7>Transport Payment API</7>, developed and
      maintained by us, which is not documented but its use is very simple and

      <1></1></21><22>It is also possible to use the library for economic or

      net salary as a function of the gross.</22><23>We can see the
      progressivity of the total wage, which is in percent lower for a minimum
      wage than for a high income. In other words, high earners pay part of the

        ## How do you calculate the partial activity allowance?

        The basic partial activity allowance is set by law at 70% of gross earnings. It is prorated according to the number of hours off work. For an employee at €2,300 gross who works 50% of his usual time, this gives **€2,300 × 50% × 70% = €805**.

        In addition to this basic allowance, there is a supplementary allowance for salaries close to the minimum wage. This additional allowance is paid when the combined remuneration and basic allowance are below a net SMIC.

        These allowances must be paid by the employer, who will then be reimbursed in part or in full by the State.

        👉 [See details of the calculation of the allowance](/documentation/contrat-salarié/activité-partielle/indemnités)


        ## How do you calculate the portion reimbursed by the state? ##

        The State covers part of the partial compensation for wages up to 4.5 SMIC, with a minimum of €8.03 per hour off.

        In concrete terms, this results in **100%** coverage for wages close to the SMIC. It then gradually decreases until it stabilizes at **93%** for wages between €2,000 and €7,000 (~ 4.5 SMIC).

        👉 [See the details of the calculation of the reimbursement of the allowance](/documentation/contrat-salarié/activité-partielle/indemnisation-entreprise)

        ## How do you report a partial activity?

        In the face of the coronavirus crisis, the modalities for partial activity have been lightened. The employer is allowed to place his employees in activity partial before the formal application is filed. It shall provide that then a period of **30 days** to comply. The benefits will be paid retroactively from the date of inception of the plan. of short-time work.

        ## What are the social contributions to be paid for the partial activity allowance?

        The partial activity allowance is subject to the CSG/CRDS and to an disease contribution in some cases. For more information, see the explanatory page on [the Urssaf website](https://www.urssaf.fr/portail/home/actualites/toute-lactualite-employeur/activite-partielle--nouveau-disp.html) (french).
