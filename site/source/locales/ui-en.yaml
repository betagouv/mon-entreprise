        ## How do you calculate the partial activity allowance?

        The basic partial activity allowance is set by law at 70% of gross earnings. It is prorated according to the number of hours off work. For an employee at €2,300 gross who works 50% of his usual time, this gives **€2,300 × 50% × 70% = €805**.

        In addition to this basic allowance, there is a supplementary allowance for salaries close to the minimum wage. This additional allowance is paid when the combined remuneration and basic allowance are below a net SMIC.

        These allowances must be paid by the employer, who will then be reimbursed in part or in full by the State.

        👉 [See details of the calculation of the allowance](/documentation/contrat-salarié/activité-partielle/indemnités)


        ## How do you calculate the portion reimbursed by the state? ##

        The State covers part of the partial compensation for wages up to 4.5 SMIC, with a minimum of €8.03 per hour off.

        In concrete terms, this results in **100%** coverage for wages close to the SMIC. It then gradually decreases until it stabilizes at **93%** for wages between €2,000 and €7,000 (~ 4.5 SMIC).

        👉 [See the details of the calculation of the reimbursement of the allowance](/documentation/contrat-salarié/activité-partielle/indemnisation-entreprise)

        ## How do you report a partial activity?

        In the face of the coronavirus crisis, the modalities for partial activity have been lightened. The employer is allowed to place his employees in activity partial before the formal application is filed. It shall provide that then a period of **30 days** to comply. The benefits will be paid retroactively from the date of inception of the plan. of short-time work.

        👉 [Apply for short-time work](https://www.service-public.fr/professionnels-entreprises/vosdroits/R31001) (french)

        ## What are the social contributions to be paid for the partial activity allowance?

        The partial activity allowance is subject to the CSG/CRDS and to an disease contribution in some cases. For more information, see the explanatory page on [the Urssaf website](https://www.urssaf.fr/portail/home/actualites/toute-lactualite-employeur/activite-partielle--nouveau-disp.html) (french).

    An economic activity carried out by a single natural person in his or her own name. Less formalities, but more risks in the event of bankruptcy, because your personal assets can be put to use.

    You cannot be held personally liable for the company's debts or obligations. On the other hand, the creation process is a little more cumbersome, since it includes the drafting of statutes and the deposit of capital.

  transcript-NO_AUTO_TRANSLATION: "<0>Three minutes to understand the challenges
    of social security.</0><1>The purpose of social security is to protect
    people living in France when certain events occur during their
    lives.</1><2>Its budget consists of expenses mainly in the form of benefits
    and of income, financed partly by contributions. Income is managed by the
    collection branch made up of the URSSAF agencies. Regarding expenses, there
    are four branches. The health insurance branch covers hospital costs,
    medecine and consultations. The retirement pension branch registers on each
    person's old-age account their income received throughout their working life
    using companies online declarations in order to calculate and pay pensions.
    the occupational risks branch covers the costs related to occupational
    diseases and accidents at work. the family branch provides various benefits
    regarding birth and child care and allowances for education and housing for
    example. These four branches form the general scheme of the Social Security
    system. Besides the general scheme there are specific organizations such as
    the MSA for farmers and special schemes.</2><3>All people living in France
    help to fund the Social Security system which in  return provides cover for
    all of them. The principle is that of a \"common pot\" which works through
    solidarity each person pays contributions based on their income rather than
    on their risks.</3><4>The Social Security system by providing pensions and
    paying for medical care has extended life expectancy in France by three
    months every year in the past 20 years. This progress leads to financing
    difficulties: longer life expectancy implies more pensions and higher health
    expenses which unbalance the system. To restore its balance, measures are
    being taken especially by extending the contributions duration.</4><5>The
    Social Security system is also increasing its services such as childcare
    capacity for children aged up to three so their parents can keep working. It
    is also developing preventive actions, running immunization campaigns
    programs for the early screening of certain diseases, actions for post
    Hospital support at home, and information about fall danger among the
    elderly.</5><6>Founded seventy years ago, the French Social Security system
    has not only enabled the French to live longer but also better it will
    continue evolving to build the services that meet their needs you.</6>"
