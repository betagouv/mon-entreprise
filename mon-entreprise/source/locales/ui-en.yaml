      rule you want the value of. Here is an example for the gross / net
      calculation</11><12><0></0></12><13>Setting up the calculation</13><14>As
      you will have seen in the previous example, the recipe for a calculation
      is simple: input variables (gross salary), one or more output variables
      (net salary).</14><15>However, the calculation can be parameterized with
      all the possibilities allowed in the legislation.</15><16>All these
      variables are listed and explained in the <2>online documentation</2>.
      This documentation is auto-generated from the publicodes rule files, so it
      is constantly updated.</16><17>Let's run a calculation closer to a
      payslip: here is a description of the input situation annotated with links
      to the corresponding pages of the documentation :</17><18><0> An
      <3>executive</3> earning <7>3,400€ gross</7>, who benefits from
      <11>restaurant vouchers</11> and works in a company with <15>22

      example:</19><20><0></0></20><21><0></0>Note that in the previous example
      we have to specify the transport payment rate ourselves.</21><22>Whereas
      in the <2>employee</2> simulator, you only have to fill in the
      municipality and the corresponding rate is automatically determined. This
      is intentional: to keep the library (and the site) light, we use two
      online APIs. The<4>Geo - communes API</4> to switch from the commune name
      to the commune code. Then the<7>Transport Pay API</7>, developed and
      maintained by us, which is not documented but its use is very simple and
      understandable <10>in this React component that calls it</10>, a component
      that also uses the common API.</22><23>Making economic graphics{emoji('
      📈')}</23><24>It is also possible to use the library for economic or
      political analysis calculations. Here, labour prices and net wages are
      plotted against gross wages.</24><25>One can see the progressiveness of
      the total wage, which is in percent lower for a minimum wage than for a
      high income. In other words, high earners pay part of the social security
      contributions of low earners.</25><26><0></0></26>"

        ## How do you calculate the partial activity allowance?

        The basic partial activity allowance is set by law at 70% of gross earnings. It is prorated according to the number of hours off work. For an employee at €2,300 gross who works 50% of his usual time, this gives **€2,300 × 50% × 70% = €805**.

        In addition to this basic allowance, there is a supplementary allowance for salaries close to the minimum wage. This additional allowance is paid when the combined remuneration and basic allowance are below a net SMIC.

        These allowances must be paid by the employer, who will then be reimbursed in part or in full by the State.

        👉 [See details of the calculation of the allowance](/documentation/contrat-salarié/activité-partielle/indemnités)


        ## How do you calculate the portion reimbursed by the state? ##

        The State covers part of the partial compensation for wages up to 4.5 SMIC, with a minimum of €8.03 per hour off.

        In concrete terms, this results in **100%** coverage for wages close to the SMIC. It then gradually decreases until it stabilizes at **93%** for wages between €2,000 and €7,000 (~ 4.5 SMIC).

        👉 [See the details of the calculation of the reimbursement of the allowance](/documentation/contrat-salarié/activité-partielle/indemnisation-entreprise)

        ## How do you report a partial activity?

        In the face of the coronavirus crisis, the modalities for partial activity have been lightened. The employer is allowed to place his employees in activity partial before the formal application is filed. It shall provide that then a period of **30 days** to comply. The benefits will be paid retroactively from the date of inception of the plan. of short-time work.

        ## What are the social contributions to be paid for the partial activity allowance?

        The partial activity allowance is subject to the CSG/CRDS and to an disease contribution in some cases. For more information, see the explanatory page on [the Urssaf website](https://www.urssaf.fr/portail/home/actualites/toute-lactualite-employeur/activite-partielle--nouveau-disp.html) (french).
