      interface in 5 minutes{emoji('‚åö')}, without having to deal with the
      complexity of payroll and the regular updating of calculation

      online documentation</8><9>As you can see from the previous example, the
      recipe for a calculation is simple: input variables (gross wage), one or
      more output variables (net wage).</9><10>All these variables are listed
      and explained in our <2>online documentation</2>.</10><11>Use the search
      engine to find the right variable, then click on \"View source code\" to
      get all the documentation: default value, possible values when it's an
      enumeration of choice, unit when it's a number, description, associated
      user question, etc.</11><12>Let's run a calculation closer to a payslip:
      Here is a description of the input situation with links to the
      corresponding pages of the documentation :</12><13> An <3>executive</3>

      allowance</10> and works in a company with <14>12
      employees</14>.</13><14>The calculation for this more complete example is
      as follows:</14><15><0></0></15><16>{emoji('‚ÑπÔ∏è ')} Note that in the
      previous example we have to specify the transport payment rate
      ourselves.</16><17>Whereas in the <2>employee</2> simulator, it is
      sufficient to fill in the municipality and the corresponding rate is
      automatically determined. It's intentional: to keep the library (and the
      site) light, we use two online APIs. The<4> Geo API - communes</4> to
      switch from the commune name to the common code. Then the<7> transport
      payout API</7>, developed and maintained by us, which is not documented
      but its use is very simple and understandable <10>in this React component
      that calls it</10>, a component that also uses the common
      API.</17><18>Making economic charts{emoji(' üìà')}</18><19>It is also
      possible to use the library for economic or political analysis
      calculations. Here, the price of labour and the net wage is plotted
      against the gross wage.</19><20>We can see the progressiveness of the
      total wage, which is in percent lower for a minimum wage than for a high
      income. In other words, high-wage earners pay part of the social security
      contributions of low-wage earners.</20><21>{emoji('‚ö†Ô∏è ')}Beware, this
      example does a lot of calculations in one go, which can block your browser
      for a few seconds. To overcome this problem, you would have to call the

        ## How do you calculate the partial activity allowance?

        The basic partial activity allowance is set by law at 70% of gross earnings. It is prorated according to the number of hours off work. For an employee at ‚Ç¨2,300 gross who works 50% of his usual time, this gives **‚Ç¨2,300 √ó 50% √ó 70% = ‚Ç¨805**.

        In addition to this basic allowance, there is a supplementary allowance for salaries close to the minimum wage. This additional allowance is paid when the combined remuneration and basic allowance are below a net SMIC.

        These allowances must be paid by the employer, who will then be reimbursed in part or in full by the State.

        üëâ [See details of the calculation of the allowance](/documentation/contrat-salari√©/activit√©-partielle/indemnit√©s)


        ## How do you calculate the portion reimbursed by the state? ##

        The State covers part of the partial compensation for wages up to 4.5 SMIC, with a minimum of ‚Ç¨8.03 per hour off.

        In concrete terms, this results in **100%** coverage for wages close to the SMIC. It then gradually decreases until it stabilizes at **93%** for wages between ‚Ç¨2,000 and ‚Ç¨7,000 (~ 4.5 SMIC).

        üëâ [See the details of the calculation of the reimbursement of the allowance](/documentation/contrat-salari√©/activit√©-partielle/indemnisation-entreprise)

        ## How do you report a partial activity?

        In the face of the coronavirus crisis, the modalities for partial activity have been lightened. The employer is allowed to place his employees in activity partial before the formal application is filed. It shall provide that then a period of **30 days** to comply. The benefits will be paid retroactively from the date of inception of the plan. of short-time work.

        üëâ [Apply for short-time work](https://www.service-public.fr/professionnels-entreprises/vosdroits/R31001) (french)

        ## What are the social contributions to be paid for the partial activity allowance?

        The partial activity allowance is subject to the CSG/CRDS and to an disease contribution in some cases. For more information, see the explanatory page on [the URSSAF website](https://www.urssaf.fr/portail/home/actualites/toute-lactualite-employeur/activite-partielle--nouveau-disp.html) (french).

      seo: <0>How is the partial activity allowance calculated?</0><1>The basic
        partial activity allowance is fixed by law at <2>70% of gross</2>
        salary. It is prorated according to the number of hours off work. For an
        employee at ‚Ç¨ 2300 gross monthly, who works 50% of his usual time, this
        gives <5>‚Ç¨ 2300 √ó 50% √ó 70% = ‚Ç¨ 805</5>.</1><2>In addition to this basic
        allowance, there is a supplementary allowance for salaries close to the
        minimum wage. This additional allowance is paid when the combined
        remuneration and basic allowance are below a net SMIC. These allowances
        are paid by the employer, who will then be reimbursed in part or in full
        by the State.</2><3>üëâ <2>See the details of the calculation of</2> the
        allowance</3><4> How to calculate the part reimbursed by the
        State?</4><5>The State covers part of the partial compensation for wages
        up to **4.5 SMIC**, with a minimum of ‚Ç¨8.03 per unemployed hour. In
        concrete terms, this results in 100% coverage for salaries close to the
        SMIC. This gradually decreases until it stabilizes at **93%** for wages
        <3>between ‚Ç¨2,000 and ‚Ç¨7,000</3> (wage corresponding to the limit of 4.5
        SMIC).</5><6>üëâ <2>See details of the calculation of the reimbursement
        of the allowance</2></6><7> How to report a partial activity?</7><8>In
        response to the coronavirus crisis, the conditions for partial
        employment have been eased. The employer is allowed to place his
        employees in partial activity before the official application is filed.
        The employee then has a period of <2>30 days</2> to comply with the
        regulations. Benefits will be paid retroactively from the date of the
        partial unemployment.</8><9>üëâ <2>Applying for partial unemployment</2>
