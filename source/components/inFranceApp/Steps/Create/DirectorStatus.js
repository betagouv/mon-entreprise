			This choice is important because it determines the type of Social Security
			coverage for which the director is eligible.

		<p>
			<strong> Salaried</strong> or <strong>self-employed</strong> ? The
			director’s Social Security coverage depends on the legal structure that
			has been chosen and the responsibilities led within it.

		<ul>
			<li>
				<strong>Salaried employee:</strong> The company director joins and is
				covered by France’s general Social Security scheme. Social Security
				contributions are calculated on the basis of the executive&apos;s actual

			</li>
			<li>
				<strong>Self-employed:</strong> The company director joins and is
				covered by France’s self-employed scheme called « Sécurité sociale pour
				les indépendants ». Contributions due are generally calculated based on
				professional income as reported to the tax authorities.
